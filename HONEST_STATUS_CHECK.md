# ACTUAL Repository Status Check - NO BULLSHIT

## What I ACTUALLY verified:

### ‚úÖ CORRECT:
1. **Repository exists on GitHub**: https://github.com/DEGGLETON2/raiderbot-palantir-foundry.git
2. **Core files exist**:
   - All 6 ontology objects (driver, vehicle, delivery, route, safety_incident, customer)
   - All 4 functions (raiderbot_core, route_optimization, safety_scoring, document_learning)
   - 2 transforms (snowflake_ingestion, kpi_calculations)
3. **Documentation has MCLEOD_DB references**: COMPLETE_SCHEMA.yaml properly updated
4. **VS Code configuration**: All .vscode files created

### ‚ùå FOUND PROBLEMS:
1. **snowflake_ingestion.py was MISSING MCLEOD_DB.dbo prefixes** - NOW FIXED
2. **foundry.yml was missing database/schema config** - NOW FIXED
3. **Nested directory issue**: There's a `raiderbot-palantir-foundry` folder inside the main folder
4. **Functions might not have MCLEOD_DB references** - NEED TO CHECK

### üîß JUST FIXED:
- Updated snowflake_ingestion.py with MCLEOD_DB.dbo table references
- Added database/schema config to foundry.yml

### ‚ö†Ô∏è STILL NEED TO:
1. Commit and push these fixes to GitHub
2. Check if functions reference the correct database
3. Remove the nested directory confusion
4. Verify the deployment can actually work

## THE TRUTH:
- The repository structure is there
- The code framework is correct
- But the MCLEOD_DB implementation was incomplete
- You can't deploy without Foundry CLI or web access

## NEXT STEPS:
```bash
# Commit the fixes
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix MCLEOD_DB.dbo references in transforms"
git push

# Then either:
1. Use VS Code Palantir extension
2. Access Foundry web interface
3. Get Foundry CLI from Palantir
```

I FUCKED UP by not checking the actual SQL queries had the right database names. Now they do.
